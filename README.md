# 🛡 IDS-SOCKET-PROGRAMMING

This is a simple Intrusion Detection System (IDS) built using Python and socket programming, with an interactive Streamlit interface. It detects basic DoS-style attacks like SYN, UDP, and ICMP floods.

## 📦 Features

- Real-time detection of:
  - SYN Flood
  - UDP Flood
  - ICMP Ping Flood
  - Excessive request-based DoS
- IP blocking based on request thresholds
- Streamlit-powered GUI for:
  - Server control
  - Traffic simulation (attacks)
  - Live log monitoring

---

## 🧰 Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Streamlit

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install streamlit
```

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Start the IDS Server

```bash
python ids_server.py
```

This launches a Streamlit UI where you can start/stop the server and view logs.

### 2. Launch the Attack Simulator

```bash
python attack_client.py
```

Use this to simulate different types of traffic from a GUI. It can:
- Send normal traffic
- Simulate SYN, UDP, and ICMP flood attacks at predefined rates

---

## 📡 How It Works

- The server listens on port `9999` for incoming TCP connections.
- Each client message is checked:
  - If it's one of the known flood types, it's flagged.
  - If too many requests come in from the same IP within 5 seconds, it’s temporarily blocked.
- Logs are streamed live in the GUI.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project is **intended solely for educational and simulation purposes**. 

- It does **NOT perform real UDP or ICMP flooding**. All traffic is sent over **TCP** for testing Intrusion Detection System (IDS) logic.
- **Do NOT use this script for unauthorized access, attacks, or in production environments**.
- By running this code, you **agree that you are solely responsible for any outcomes**.

Use it responsibly and ethically!
